//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
//BFS

//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare:
//BFS (there could be problems with memory though), because DFS would take a lot of time.

//If the tree is very wide:
//DFS, because BFS would need too much memory (BFS needs to track nodes in the current level)

//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
//DFS

//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
//DFS

//Finding the shortest path:
//BFS
